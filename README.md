# Eloquent-JavaScript-exercise-solutions
Solutions to the exercises presented in the book "Eloquent JavaScript", 3rd edition by Marijn Haverbeke.

Solutions are categorized as individual files per exercise, further organized into directories of which each one corresponds to a certain chapter. For example, the solution to exercise two in the third chapter of the book is located in the directory named "chapter-3" in the file named "e2-recursion.js" where the first part of the filename ("e2" in this case) represents the exercise number, and the rest of the file name represents the name of the exercise ("recursion" in this case).

<strong>Note</strong>: All solutions are my own, produced without previously consulting the official solutions provided in the book's code sandbox. In some cases my solutions are more efficient or provide <em>lovelier</em> formatting, and in others the opposite is true.

<strong>Note</strong>: For some problems I have provided multiple solutions which I have properly noted via comments and accordingly named. For example, I have provided 3 solutions for the <em>Vec</em> class which have been named <em>Vec_v1</em>, <em>Vec_v2</em> and <em>Vec_v3</em>.
